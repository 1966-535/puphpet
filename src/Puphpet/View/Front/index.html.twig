                    <h3>What is this?</h3>

                    <p>
                        PuPHPet is for rapid generation of Vagrant VMs provisioned by Puppet, specifically made for those that
                        don't have the time or interest in learning the details.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The idea came to me when I was struggling to get from no previous Vagrant/Puppet knowledge to simply
                        having a running VM I could start developing on. Why should I need to learn the ins and outs when
                        all I want to do is faceroll more code?
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="span6">
                    <h3>Who is it for?</h3>

                    <p>
                        This is aimed at PHP developers that do not have the time or inclination to learn a whole new system.
                        You want to get started programming on an easily managed VM quickly, with as little fuss as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is not meant to be used in production. The choices are limited by design, I will probably only
                        ever focus on the official Vagrant Ubuntu boxes, and as of right now you cannot choose specific
                        versions of packages to install, only the latest of each.
