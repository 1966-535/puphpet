            My name is Juan. I like building things people love to use. I hope you enjoy PuPHPet!
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-header">What's all this about, then?</h2>

        <p>
            This is a gui configurator for the <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> automation tool. It uses
            <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> as the provisioning backend.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is similar to another tool that recently came out, <a href="http://rove.io">Rove.io</a>, although
            that one is more focused on using Vagrant with Chef, and has different configuration options.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-header">What is Vagrant/Puppet and why should I care?</h2>

        <p>
            I used to develop locally on a virtual machine. In fact, I wrote a length, detailed step-by-step tutorial
            (<a href="https://jtreminio.com/2012/07/setting-up-a-debian-vm-step-by-step">Setting Up a Debian VM, Step by Step</a>)
            that goes through the process from beginning to end on setting up a Debian VM. It works wonderfully, and
            I love editing my files on my daily OS (Windows back then, OS X now), and running the applications within
            a proper environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first problem is obvious: there is a lot of setup involved. Just look at that tutorial. From beginning
            to end it may take upward of an hour to do the whole process! What happens if you mess up somewhere? You
            have to start all over!
        </p>

        <p>
            The next problem comes after you've got the VM up and running. I had to be very careful when making changes
            to the system, because I was afraid of screwing it up and having to either restart it from scratch or
            googling trying to undo the damage.
        </p>

        <p>
            The third large issue is, how to properly share my environment with other developers? Do I *really* want
            to upload this multi-GB file? That's a big pain in the butt!
        </p>

        <p>
            Vagrant and Puppet takes care of all these issues, and more, for you!
        </p>

        <p>
            The Debian tutorial can be written once, and run multiple times. I no longer hae to worry about damaging my
            VM environment - if I screw something up, destroy it, re-run Vagrant, and within 3 minutes I have a fully
            working envornment once again! To share, I simply point developers to my Github repo where they download
            appx. 50KB of text files and run Vagrant on their own machines! Awesome!
        </p>
